Our goal is to take a minimal set of Open source technologies, combine them into a single solution for Data Science specialists. 
We are to create a de facto standard for different scenarios. 

These scenarios inlcude both:
  * DS develops code in a personal environment
  * a development in a DS team on virtual machines on-premises
  * the solution deployment in enterprise based on Kubernetes
  * a Cloud based scenario

We want to create a community and education environment around all this, so that the DS folks, having once learned, can work in the all above scenarios.
DS will seamlessly move from the one to the other.

What is the essence of our solution is we are going to take a minimum set - Jupiter stack, Spark, Distributed storage (HDFS+Apache Ozon).
