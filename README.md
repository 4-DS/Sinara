# Sinara
Our goal is to take a minimal set of Open source technologies and combine them into a single solution for Data Science specialists. 
We create a de facto standard for different scenarios. 

These scenarios include:
  * DS develops code in a personal environment;
  * a development in a DS team on virtual machines on-premises;
  * the solution deployment in enterprise based on Kubernetes;
  * a Cloud based scenario.

We want to create a community and education environment around all this. So that the DS folks, having once learned, can work in all the above scenarios.
DS will seamlessly move from the one to the other.

We are going to take a minimum set - Jupiter stack, Spark, Distributed storage (HDFS+Apache Ozon). It's the essence of our solution.
